## 💡 `Extra Information`

### Why Learn HTML First?

HTML is the skeleton of a webpage. Without understanding its structure:

- Styling (CSS) and interactions (JavaScript) will be harder to implement.
- You won't create accessible, well-structured websites.

### Tips for Success:

- Practice writing code instead of copying.
- Use developer tools in your browser to inspect and learn from live websites.
- Experiment with building simple structures, like:
  - A personal profile page.
  - A simple blog layout.

Keep experimenting, and have fun learning!
